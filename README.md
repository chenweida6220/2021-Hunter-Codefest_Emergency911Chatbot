# 2021-Hunter-Codefest_Emergency911Chatbot
Calling 911 for nonemergencies is simply a waste of resources. Don't call 911 for issues like reporting traffic accidents, reporting crimes that have already taken place, or being as quiet as possible while trying to reach for help (home break-in). Why not use the 911 emergency chatbot?
